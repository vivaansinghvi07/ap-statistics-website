# ap-statistics-website
A complementary website for AP Statistics, built with HTML/CSS/Javascript, but using PHP for template inheritance. It features tons of tools, which range from graphing to analyzing data. Everything is simple, easy to use, and minimalistic. It is linked [here](https://vivaans-statistics-site.000webhostapp.com/index.php).
